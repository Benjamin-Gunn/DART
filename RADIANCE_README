we got the rttov files by starting at this web page:

https://www.nwpsaf.eu/site/software/rttov

you have to register for a free account before you
download the code.


the forward operator code, as it is so far, is in
this directory:

observations/forward_operators

look at these files:

radiance_fwd_example.F90  - a standalone example from
   the rttov distribution showing how to use their code

rtcoef_eos_2_amsua.dat - a data file of coefficients that 
   are needed by the rttov code

obs_def_rttov_mod.f90  - a first stab at a forward operator

rttov_interface_mod.f90  - support routines that interface
   to the rttov code.  these aren't finished - they are mostly
   the example program code dropped into a module with a lot
   of comments about how we need to alter things to run.


the observation converter is here:

observations/obs_converters/AIRS

documentation is in the 2 pdf files.

in the work directory you want to make/run:

convert_airs_rad_L2

this requires the JPL EOS libraries.  see
the BUILDME script for help in building this
for your mac.  on cheyenne i have the files
in my home dir already.

example EOS reader code is in the readers directory.
unpack the tar file.



we haven't tried running this FO with any of 
the models because we aren't that far along yet.

it requires a model that uses the threed_sphere
locations, and can return interpolated values for:

QTY_PRESSURE, QTY_TEMPERATURE, and QTY_SPECIFIC_HUMIDITY

JPH (general notes)

# gas_units (water vapor mixing ratio)
  * kg/kg
  * interpolate QVAPOR
  * moist air / dry air
  * assume moist air
# are pressures on cell centers
# surface type [x-land, x-ice]
  * land only interp if all 4 boxes are land
  * longterm : distingish between land and ice
# skin temperature (duplicate 2m temp)
  * soil temperature (TSBL
  * sea surface temperature (SST)
# azumath, latitude
# elevation (get from observation)
# (:) levels
# elevation == surface elevation
  * dont know what we are doing FIXME
  * what is converter doing?
  * ? initation surface elevation
  * -> interpolatin to elevation of location
# use 'get_date'
# check wether instrument needs minimum amout of info (AQUA, AIRS)
# no cfp
# NCAR ensemble reanaysis (Glen)
  * -> not very cloudy time (September)
  * -> do a bunch of F.O.
