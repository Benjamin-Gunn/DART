if a file is not already in tar format, it probably
needs to be 'uncosblocked'.  

there is a copy of the 'cosconvert' executable on cheyenne
in the /glade/p/cisl/dares/Observations/bufr directory.  

to use:

./cosconvert -b Annnnn YYYYMM.tar 

now tar -tvf YYYYMM.tar should give you a good list of files.
