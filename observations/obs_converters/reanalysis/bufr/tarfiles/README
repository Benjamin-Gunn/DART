i did the conversion of obs files up to mid 2019.
jeff stewart converted the rest of the 2019 files and jan 2020.  

these scripts assume you can get the files directly off the
HPSS, which is going away soon.  the task is the same but
the method will have to be different.

you want to ask DSS (i've always dealt with Chi-Fan) for access
to the "prepqm" obs files used in the reanalysis dataset 090.0,
specifically the version that includes ACARS obs.
