PROGRAM ``restart_file_tool``
=============================

.. attention::

   ``restart_file_tool`` works with versions of DART *before* Manhattan (9.x.x) but is no longer needed. DART initial
   condition and restart files are now in NetCDF format and any standard NetCDF tool can be used to manipulate them.
