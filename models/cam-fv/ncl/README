See 2018-11-15, below, for most recent way to make SST files.
----------------------------

The 1/4 degree Reynolds SSTs are available in
/home/tomas/ds277.7/avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.20050101_cat_20051231_filled_c130829.nc
This data set runs through 2013-7 so far, but the raw data are available from
monthly updates.

It looks like it's ready to be used by CAM, 
except that the files I've used are monthly (CAM interpolates to daily)
while these are daily.
>  What do I need to change in CAM to use these?

I may be able to make more recent dates using 
/glade/u/home/tomas/frank/high_res_data/forcing_summer_13/make_sst_ice_forcing.ncl
(see local copy) which was used to make
avhrr-only-v2.20050101_cat_20051231_filled_c130829.nc
And a script which fills in the land areas using a Poisson scheme.  
This solves problems created when there are grid boxes where CAM 
expects to find an SST value but there isn't one in the Reynold's SST (there is land).
./fill_sst_forcing.ncl
See 2018-11-15, below, for my attempt to do this.

I need a domain.ocn file.  The make_sst_ice_forcing.ncl lists
/glade/home/tomas/cesm/cesm1_1_beta15/mapping/gen_atm_ocn_maps/domain.ocn.0.25.120821.nc
but I can't find that file in the more modern location:
/glade/u/home/tomas/...anywhere
Nor on the HPSS.
Ha! I did find an archive of Bob Tomas' home directory:
/home/tomas/home_bf_31jan13.tar
which I could download.  The file seems to be in there!

Is this in a form CAM can use?

Starting to define a new compset (2016-2-29; actually a 'resolution').
   x Get new CAM tag (and CESM host?) from Eaton
   x Read Bob's /glade/u/home/tomas/cesm1_cases_doc/f.e11.b16.F2000C5.ne120_025_bob_011bf.txt
     Instructions in http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.3/cesm/doc/usersguide/x2417.html
        SCRIP files:
           See /glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/makemaps/0.25x0.25_fv0.47x0.63_100723
        ?  /glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/grids/0.25x0.25_100723.nc
        ?  ..................................../fv0.9x1.25_141008.nc
        Tomas used in $p/Models/CAM_init/SST/gen_atm_ocn_maps/regridbatch.bluefire.sh
        CESM1.2 web says build the check_map.sh utility
> cd $p/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/check_maps
Follow instructions in README
Those files don't work in check_maps.
Because they're grid files?  SCRIP files?  both?
Ah, maybe I was supposed to just build it, not run it yet.

Move on to Step 3 of instructions:
> $CCSMROOT/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files/gen_cesm_maps.sh
  should generate mapping files.
  But it needs the SCRIP files I was supposed to find in 1.
  The example scripts:
      regridbatch.yellowstone.sh   
         griddir1="/glade/scratch/mlevy/grids"
         fileocn="${griddir1}/tx0.1v2_090127.nc"
         cmdargs="--fileocn $fileocn ...
         env REGRID_PROC=$REGRID_PROC ./gen_cesm_maps.sh $cmdargs
      
      But /glade/scratch/mlevy/grids/tx0.1v2_090127.nc    doesn't exist anymore.
      But but look in /glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/makemaps/0.25x0.25_fv0.47x0.63_100723
         scrip_makemaps.csh refers to the outdated
            /fis/cgd/cseg/csm/mapping/grids
         The modern location is (?)
            /glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/grids
         In there I see  (the same files I tried in check_maps, above)
            0.25x0.25_100723.nc
            fv0.9x1.25_141008.nc
         This uses ESMF offline weight generation utility, which I need to build(?).
         No
         $ module load esmf
         $ module load esmf-6.3.0r-ncdfio-uni-O
         $ which ESMF_RegridWeightGen
           /glade/apps/opt/esmf/6.3.0r-ncdfio/intel/12.1.5/bin/binO/Linux.intel.64.mpiuni.default/ESMF_RegridWeightGen
     
      So, modify regridbatch.yellowstone.sh to use the grid files:
        griddir1="/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/grids"
        fileocn="${griddir1}/0.25x0.25_100723.nc"
        fileatm="${griddir1}/fv0.9x1.25_141008.nc"
      I submitted regrid... in 
         /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files

4. Generate atmosphere, land and ocean / ice domain files.
   The instructions in 
      /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/gen_domain_files/INSTALL
   needed to have -cimeroot $CIMEROOT appended to the configure command
   After building gen_domain, I ran
   $ gen_domain -m ../gen_mapping_files/map_0.25x0.25_TO_fv0.9x1.25_aave.150824.nc \
                -o 0.25x0.25 \
                -l fv0.9x1.25 \
                -c "domain file for a 1/4-degree ocean + 1-degree FV atmosphere for ATM_forc_XXX assimilations"
     write domain.lnd.fv0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25.150824.nc
     successfully created domain file domain.lnd.fv0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25.150824.nc
     write domain.ocn.fv0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25.150824.nc
     successfully created domain file domain.ocn.fv0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25.150824.nc

7.  Manually created 
    /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/gen_domain_files/ATM_forc_XXX.xml
    I removed all the GLOB lines because each of these component grids already exists in CESM.

8.  Need to append mapping file path names to the end of user_nl_cpl during the setup:
       setenv MAPPING_FILE_LOC = /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files
       atm2ocnFmapname='$MAPPING_FILE_LOC/map_fv0.9x1.25_TO_0.25x0.25_aave.150824.nc'
       atm2ocnSmapname='$MAPPING_FILE_LOC/map_fv0.9x1.25_TO_0.25x0.25_blin.150824.nc'
       atm2ocnVmapname='$MAPPING_FILE_LOC/map_fv0.9x1.25_TO_0.25x0.25_patc.150824.nc'
       ocn2atmFmapname='$MAPPING_FILE_LOC/map_0.25x0.25_TO_fv0.9x1.25_aave.150824.nc'
       ocn2atmSmapname='$MAPPING_FILE_LOC/map_0.25x0.25_TO_fv0.9x1.25_aave.150824.nc'
       lnd2rofFmapname='$MAPPING_FILE_LOC/not_created_for_data_ocean_runs'
       rof2lndFmapname='$MAPPING_FILE_LOC/not_created_for_data_ocean_runs'
    This is installed in $trunk_cam/shell_scripts/CESM1_4_b6_setup_advanced.

It's hard to parse how files like 
avhrr-only-v2.20100101_cat_20101231_filled_c130829.nc
were created from a series of files like
/gpfs/fs1/collections/rda/data/ds277.7/avhrr/2010/avhrr-only-v2.20100101.nc.

I replaced all of the avhrr-only-v2.201[1-7]_filled_c*.nc
with files that don't have the days from the bracketing years.
So now each file has just the days from the year in the file name.
Temporarily, the files with the bracketing days are in 
$fname:r_temp.nc
