SEIR
====

Overview
--------

The extended SEIR Model with Vaccination was first proposed by Ghostine et al. (2021)
to simulate the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread. The model considers 7
stages of infection:
1. Susceptible (S),
2. Exposed (E),
3. Infected (I),
4. Quarantined (Q),
5. Recovered (R),
6. Deaths (D),
7. Vaccinated (V).
