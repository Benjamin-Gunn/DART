I'm confused by the selection of QTYs that can be associated
with the Aether variables.  I made some choices in the early rush
to get something working, but now I'd like to figure out if they were good choices.
I don't even know how to decide whether it matters (much).

My first problem is interpretting what the available QTY's represent.
I haven't found a key to decipher the parts of, e.g.  QTY_DENSITY_ION_O2DP .
O2 could mean 'oxygen molecule', D could mean an extra or missing electron
from the D orbital, P could be similar, or mean 'positive'.
Or O could mean 'oxygen atom' with 2D or 2DP meaning something.
Comments in space_quantities_mod.f90 or in a docs.dart page would be helpful.

The Aether variable 'velocity_parallel_up\ \(O+\)'
could potentially have these existing QTYs associated with it:
QTY_VELOCITY_W 
QTY_VELOCITY_W_ION 
QTY_VERTICAL_VELOCITY
or maybe it should have a new QTY like the existing QTY_VELOCITY_VERTICAL_O2:
QTY_VELOCITY_PARALLEL_VERTICAL_OP 
This last seems safest, since each ion has its own 2 vertical velocities.
But I don't know how they'll be used, so maybe a simple, generic QTY 
for all the ions is fine.

      QTY_VELOCITY_VERTICAL_O2 
! But not for the other components

! or more specific QTYs (but maybe not a complete set?)
! There seems to be choice for for some chemicals,

! The chosen files need to be added to the preprocess_nml.
